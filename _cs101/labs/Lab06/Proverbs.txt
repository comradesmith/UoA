Look before your leap.
All that glitters is not gold.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Many hands make light work.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
No man is an island.
People who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
Better late than never.
Hope for the best but prepare for the worst.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
There's no place like home.
The early bird catches the word.
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.
You can't break an omelet without breaking a few eggs.
You can't always get what you want.
A watched pot never boils.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Actions speak louder than words.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Practice makes perfect.
Easy come, easy go.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
All good things must come to an end.
If you can't beat them, join them.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
There's no time like the present.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
Familiarity breeds contempt.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Good things come to those who wait.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Two heads are better than one.
The grass is always greener on the other side of the hill.
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
Honesty is the best policy.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.
Don't count your chickens until they hatch.
If you want something done right you have to do it yourself.
