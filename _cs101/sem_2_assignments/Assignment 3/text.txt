While a program is running, its data is stored in random access memory (RAM). 
RAM is fast and inexpensive, but it is also volatile, which means that when the program ends, or the computer shuts down, data in RAM disappears. 
To make data available the next time the computer is turned on and the program is started, it has to be written to a non-volatile storage medium, such a hard drive, usb drive, or CD-RW.
 
Data on non-volatile storage media is stored in named locations on the media called files. 
By reading and writing files, programs can save information between program runs.
 
Working with files is a lot like working with a notebook. 
To use a notebook, it has to be opened. When done, it has to be closed. 
While the notebook is open, it can either be read from or written to. 
In either case, the notebook holder knows where they are. 
They can read the whole notebook in its natural order or they can skip around.
 
All of this applies to files as well. 
To open a file, we specify its name and indicate whether we want to read or write.
